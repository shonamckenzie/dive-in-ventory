### Dive-In Shop Inventory Project

First project at CodeClan.  The brief was to Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. The app was written in Ruby using the MVC architecture pattern, using Sinatra framework with Postgres as the database.

I decided to base my app on a dive store. I created an app that would allow the owner to check which products they have in store and whether they were available to purchase.  Products can be filtered by category and new products added to stock. It's also possible to see the Manufacturers and whether they have any special promotions on as well as create new manufacturers in the system.
There are also options to edit or delete the information provided in the inventory.
